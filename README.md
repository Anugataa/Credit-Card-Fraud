# Problem Statement : Credit Card Fraud Detection
For many banks, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. Banking fraud, however, poses a significant threat to this goal for different banks. In terms of substantial financial losses, trust and credibility, this is a concerning issue to both banks and customers alike.

# Business Understanding: Credit card fraud is any dishonest act or behaviour to obtain information without proper authorisation from the account holder for financial gain. Among different ways of committing frauds, skimming is the most common one, which is a way of duplicating information that is located on the magnetic strip of the card. Apart from this, the other ways are as follows:

- Manipulation/alteration of genuine cards
- Creation of counterfeit cards
- Stealing/loss of credit cards
- Fraudulent telemarketing

Credit Card Fraud Detection is a highly data-imbalance problem where the number of fraud transactions is much lesser than the number of non-fraudulent transaction for any bank.Our aim involves building model on such imbalanced data, and thus produce results on real-time new data. So, we can consider this as an abnormality detection task.

### Task:

- What are the general trends for Credit Card Fraud Transactions?
- What are the most important features that help us decide if the transaction is fraudulent or not?
- How do we balance the data to not let the model overfit on legitimate transactions?
- How to find the best performing model with the help of hyperparameter tuning ?
